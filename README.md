# Hackathon Tips

I am sure you guys are familiar what a hackathon is and here I am just going to talk about how to win in hackathon. From my past experiences taking part in various hackathon events, I realize that there are certain crucial criteria for you and your team to win. It is not very difficult, of course early preparation before event is necessary. Although they will tell you not to prepare anything beforehand, if you are thinking to create something awesome, trust me, 24 hours is not enough to create a mature app for demonstration. I will tell more about what I meant by "preparation" in the section later.

## Forming a team
First of all, you need to form a team in which every team member knows about their roles in the project. It is true that hackathon is one of the best ways to learn new stuff, but if you are really unfamiliar with the techniques that you are going to use but willing to learn on spot, trust me, you aren't helping at all but slowing the progress down. So, say you are good at web development but your team is going to work on Android development, you might as well create a website or do something with your specialty that can used to support the project. Below shows the duty of each role:

1. Frontend developer

This is the most important role in a team. This role requires basic understanding of programming (duh!), some prior experience in designing actual app would be better in development. Without frontend, people will never know how cool your project is.

2. Designer

Designer in general, as someone who can contribute to the aesthetic of the app, creating some cool graphics or working on visual and textual content. A visually well-designed app would definitely stand out amongst other projects in the first impression. Do not underestimate such role though, often times, they are the reason why your team wins! 

3. Fullstack developer

I would call such role as "team leader" as they are guiding the team and communicating with different roles in the team. They shouldn't be focusing on one thing but on every aspect. For example, they know enough about Android development and web development to get these two platformd working as one. It might not necessarily be the case, but what I am trying to say is that they can be fit in any role to help out. 

4. Backend developer (optional)

For hackathon wise, backend developer is relatively less important than other roles. The reason is that frontend developer can implement those APIs that can handle all the backend processes easily at no cost. For example, I use Parse API to handle the database and backend work since it is so easy to use and it's free! Also, while demoing your app, they will never see the backend process though. If they ever ask, you can tell them how it is done, though. 


## The more content you have, the better!

You might be wondering: isn't it better if you can just focus on one instead of many since time given is very little? I wouldn't agree on it, more people (>3) working on the same project would actually cause more issues (thinking about the troubles that pull and push can cause, if your team is using Github to share project, but if you guys are git pros, then I have nothing to say about it :P) , and since not everyone is working on the same stuff, others can work on powerpoint, generating ideas and such, and developing website. Your team should have the following contents:

1. Powerpoint 

A powerpoint is used for introduction purposes. It is used generally to introduce the team, address the issues and lastly talk about the solution to the issues.

2. App demonstration

Most app demonstrations that I have seen are Android, IOS and websites. Why? Because it's the easiest way to show the audience what you guys have done. Of course, there are also people bringing their hardware tools, such as Arduino or Rasberry Pi for demonstration. Here, I am talking about the case where you don't know the main topic for the event, plus, almost everyone in the room can relate when you are showing your app in smartphones. 

3. Website

Creating a website has been so much simpler and easier than before. Github does allow free website hosting too! You can use online web templates, bootstrapping, whichever you want, to create a professional website. Include some of the pictures about the app and photos that you took in the event, show people that the website is not just a random web template but a well-implemented website. 

## Preparation

Yes, you do need to prepare! If you know you are gonna work on Android and you know you are gonna use modules that you have been working on, please get yourself familiar with the code! You do not want to spend unnecessary time setting up the structure of the app which you can already start working on actual implementation (I have been there :S). 

## Presentation

Presentation is the most important part of all. Without a nice presentation, all of your hardwork will be nothing. I had once been in a presentation that due to some technical issues with the projector, we couldn't present our app to the judge and audience. Here are something that you need to bear in mind while presenting:

1. Practice in group

Make sure everyone in the team gets a chance to talk (even if it's just a sentence or two), it is very important as it shows that you guys are working together as a team. 

2. Limit your presenting time

Some of the hackathons are very strict about the presentation time limit (5 mins?), so make sure you guys can finish the presentation in within given time limit. 

3. Practice the same speech if you can't improvise

That's right. It might sound less vivid, but better than forgetting what to say especially when you are nervous! 


## Tips 

Here's a couple of useful tips:

1. Avoid talking bugs

If you certainly know doing certain action will cause the app to crash, then don't do it! Presentation is short, chances are most of the judges will not notice something that you didn't demonstrate in the presentation! Even if they ask, you can tell them what it will do without really doing it! If they insist, you could still do though, but be ready to act surprised if your app crashes because of that! Then, you can start explaining how that happens and such. 


2. Stick with original plan

Say your original plan has part A, B and C. But the time you start working on the implementation, you realize that you couldn't get B and C done because you are stuck at A, what would you do? Not showing the features? NO!! You should still stick with your plan. If A doesn't work, find alternative way to accomplish the same result. For example, you are calling some APIs to retrieve some data and due to some technical issues, you couldn't retrieve the data, and time is ticking! I would suggest you to use "fake data" and continue. "Fake data" is hardcoded data, it is totally fine when hardcoding some data for demonstrating purposes. But that's not what I meant here with "fake data". The "fake data" I meant here is when you already know typing "abc" in textbox will yield the result of "123" from the call to API, you set the system to accept "abc" and return "123" without relying the call to API. That's why it's "fake" as it's not supposed to be done so. But heck! Nobody is going to look into your code and say "Aha! I caught you!". So once the first step is done, move on to next until finish. You can come back and work on that issue once the app is done and you still have time to fix, but again, make sure you have backup in case you mess up everything. 

3. When being asked questions

So, there will be judging on your app based on the technical implementation. If you are asked about the implementation, tell them what it is confidently even if you are not very sure you are techically right. They will correct you if they know about it, and that is fine! You could always say "I always thought that way. Thanks for correcting me!" stuff like that. Trust me, they are not always the experts in the field that you are working on, throwing some "technical big words" until they stop asking! Just kidding, but you get what I mean. Don't get nervous when you are asked about it, and it would be better not telling them what is not working or telling them you are "faking" the implementation! But if that is a pretty important feature, then you might tell them so. But in general, you need to let them feel like your app is well-developed and bug-free, and that's what gets you the win!
